# Hardware specification

**Canonical source:** [`openamr-platform-hw/manufacturing/bom/components-bom.md`](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-hw/blob/main/manufacturing/bom/components-bom.md)
**Applies to:** the documented OpenAMRobot reference mobile base; verify repository revision before changing hardware or firmware.

!!! warning "Experimental project documentation"
    These instructions describe the current reference build and its measured behavior. Use physical safeguards, test with wheels clear of the floor, and revalidate after changing parts, wiring, firmware, battery chemistry, or geometry.

*Last updated: 2026-06-19.* Identification done by reading the real labels on the robot + manufacturer
datasheets. Status: ✅ = confirmed (label + datasheet), ⏳ = to read the exact label/marking.

> **Two BOMs, by scope.** This file is the **electrical / electronic** BOM (compute, drivers, motors,

## Key specs that affect configuration

### Motors — Z4BLD60-24GN-30S (ZD geared BLDC)
*Nameplate read 2026-06-19: 60 W, 24 VDC, 3000 RPM, 3.8 A, Class B Cont, IP20, **P=5**, dated 2021/07/11.*
- **3-phase, P=5 → 5 pole pairs** (confirmed on the nameplate), 24 V, **60 W**, rated current **3.8 A**.
- Motor **3000 rpm**, **spur gearbox 1:25** (gearbox **`4GN 25K`**, confirmed by the OpenAMRobot
  [sizing calculations](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-hw/blob/main/datasheets/motor-sizing-calculations.md) and the mechanical BOM) → **120 rpm
  at the wheel** (rated torque ~3.48 N·m at 25:1). ⚠️ The motor suffix **`-30S`** is a ZD series code,
  **not** the ratio — the gearbox is 4GN 25K = **25:1** (an earlier "~30:1" here was inferred from an
  analog part number and is superseded).
- **Hall sensors** for the driver's commutation (separate from the AS5040 encoder).
- ⚠️ **Pole pairs = 5** → the driver **DIP SW4/SW5** must be set for 5 pole pairs. **Set to ON/ON (= 5 pp)
  on 2026-06-19** (were OFF/OFF = 2 pp, wrong). A wrong pole-pair setting throws off the driver's
  closed-loop speed scaling (irrelevant in the current open-loop config, but set correctly). See
  [motors-drivers.md](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-hw/blob/main/electrical/motor_control/motors-drivers.md).
- ⚠️ **Gearbox 1:25** → odometry: `COUNTS_PER_REV = 1024` must be **per wheel revolution**.
  The firmware works at wheel scale (`MOTOR_MAX_RPM 80` = the configured cap, a modest headroom below
  the 120 rpm mechanical output; open-loop ~14 rpm at 20 % PWM), so the **AS5040 reads at wheel scale**
  (mounted on the output side / 1024 cnt = 1 wheel rev). **Still verify physically**: drive exactly 1 m,
  compare `/odom`.

### Drivetrain dimensions (for kinematics / odometry)
**Ground truth = the firmware config** (`lino_base_config.h`), physically measured:
- **Wheel diameter = 0.2 m** (radius 0.10 m).
- **Track (wheel separation) = 0.46 m** (`LR_WHEELS_DISTANCE`), **confirmed by tape-measure**
  (centre-to-centre of the two wheels). The CAD/URDF value of 0.4075 m is **wrong** (CAD artifact) —
  use 0.46 m; the sim `robot.sdf` still needs correcting (see the sim note below).
- With the firmware cap (`MOTOR_MAX_RPM 80` × `MAX_RPM_RATIO 0.85` = 68 rpm) → **max linear ≈ 0.71 m/s**
  (mechanical no-load ≈ **1.26 m/s** at the full **120 rpm** output — see the
  [sizing calculations](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-hw/blob/main/datasheets/motor-sizing-calculations.md)); rated torque **~3.48 N·m/wheel** (25:1).
  Reliable low-speed floors (measured on the ground): **linear 0.04–0.05 m/s, angular 0.15 rad/s** — see
  [motors-drivers.md](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-hw/blob/main/electrical/motor_control/motors-drivers.md) "measured velocity floors".

> ⚠️ **Do NOT use 0.046533 m as the wheel radius.** Earlier revisions of this BOM listed a wheel radius
> of 0.046533 m (⌀ 0.093 m) "measured on the real robot" — that was **wrong**. `0.046533` is the wheel
> **axle height (Z)** in the CAD-exported URDF, mis-propagated into the Gazebo `robot.sdf` diff-drive
> `wheel_radius` and copied here by mistake. The physical wheel is ⌀ 0.2 m (firmware, measured).
>
> **Latent simulation bug (openamr-platform-sw):** `robot.sdf` uses `wheel_radius 0.046533` /
> `wheel_separation 0.4075` while the wheel's own visual/collision cylinder is `radius 0.11` — so sim
> odometry/kinematics are scaled ~2× vs the visible model. Fix in `openamrobot_description`:
> set the diff-drive `wheel_radius` to 0.10 and `wheel_separation` to 0.46.

### Drivers — ZBLD.C20-120L2R
- **24 V ±20 %**, output **7.5 A**, **120 W**, open/closed loop (±0.5 %), ACC/DEC 0.3–10 s, 5 DI (NPN) / 2 DO.
- Speed command: internal knob (**VAR/AI1**), external **analog 0–5/10 V**, or **PWM 0–20 kHz** → on this
  robot the Teensy PWM goes to **VAR/AI2** (SW2=ON selects AI2). See [wiring-pinout.md](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-hw/blob/main/electrical/wiring/wiring-pinout.md).

### Encoders — AMS AS5040
- 10-bit magnetic; **default incremental = 256 PPR → 1024 counts/rev** in quadrature = `COUNTS_PER_REV`. ✅
- Supply **4.5–5.5 V**, but an **internal regulator allows 3.3 V operation**. **Output high level = supply
  voltage** → powered at 5 V it drove **5 V** on A/B (measured ~4 V overvoltage into the non-5 V-tolerant
  Teensy 4.0). **Fix APPLIED 2026-06-19:** supply moved to the **3.3 V** rail → 3.3 V outputs → safe.
  (Alternatives had it browned out: series R / divider / level-shifter.) See
  [encoders.md](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-hw/blob/main/electrical/sensors/encoders.md).

### Battery — 24 V (reference: DM12-7S)
- The design takes **any 24 V battery**. Reference build: **12 V, 7 Ah** sealed lead-acid (AGM), a pair
  in series = **24 V 7 Ah**. Any 24 V chemistry (LiFePO4 / Li-ion) works too — mind its own BMS/charger
  and adjust the voltage thresholds in [power.md](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-hw/blob/main/electrical/power_distribution/power.md). Batteries
  sag under load. ⚠️ No fuse / no disconnect currently — see the safety gaps in [power.md](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-hw/blob/main/electrical/power_distribution/power.md).
  Fuse sizing: 2 motors × **3.8 A** (nameplate) ≈ 7.6 A nominal + DC-DC → a **~15–20 A** fuse (above
  nominal, below the wire/battery limit). ⚠️ This is above *nominal*, not the *stall* current (a jammed
  motor draws well above 3.8 A) — confirm the stall current before finalising.

## Still to read off the robot
- **LiDAR**: confirm the model sticker (A1M8 vs other).
- **DC-DC buck**: any printed model / the regulator IC.
- **AC/DC 230→24 V converter**: brand + model + rating.
- **Gearbox**: ~~confirm the ratio~~ — **done: `4GN 25K` = 1:25** (matches the OpenAMRobot sizing calcs).

## Engineering handoff

- Record the repository commit, hardware revision, supply voltage, and test configuration with every result.
- Stop if observed wiring, component labels, geometry, or topic behavior differs from this page; resolve the discrepancy in the owning repository first.
- Report documentation or implementation defects through [the repository issue tracker](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-hw/issues).
