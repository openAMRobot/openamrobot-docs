# Wiring and pin configuration

**Canonical source:** [`openamr-platform-hw/electrical/wiring/wiring-pinout.md`](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-hw/blob/main/electrical/wiring/wiring-pinout.md)
**Applies to:** the documented OpenAMRobot reference mobile base; verify repository revision before changing hardware or firmware.

!!! warning "Experimental project documentation"
    These instructions describe the current reference build and its measured behavior. Use physical safeguards, test with wheels clear of the floor, and revalidate after changing parts, wiring, firmware, battery chemistry, or geometry.

*Last updated: 2026-06-19.*

Convention: **MOTOR1 = LEFT wheel, MOTOR2 = RIGHT wheel.** Logic level **3.3 V**.

> **Verification status (2026-06-19):** full wiring/component audit done. Physically verified —
> **drivers + motors** (ZBLD C20-120L2R + ZD Z4BLD60-24GN-30S, both drivers identical), **encoders**
> (AS5040; the 5 V→~4 V overvoltage was **fixed → now 3.3 V**, see [encoders.md](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-hw/blob/main/electrical/sensors/encoders.md)), **IMU**
> (MPU-6500, SDA18/SCL19, 3.3 V, 0x68), **Teensy = 4.0** (i.MX RT1062), **power/24 V** (no fuse / no
> battery cut-off — see [power.md](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-hw/blob/main/electrical/power_distribution/power.md)). Component list + datasheets: [components-bom.md](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-hw/blob/main/manufacturing/bom/components-bom.md).
> Still to read (completeness): LiDAR model sticker, DC-DC model, AC/DC converter, gearbox suffix.
> (Pi RAM confirmed **8 GB**, 2026-07-06 — see [raspberry-pi.md](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-hw/blob/main/electrical/computing/raspberry-pi.md).)

The complete power-and-signal wiring is shown in the harness diagram below; the sections that
follow give the exact pin/terminal tables behind it.

## Teensy 4.0 pin assignment

| Function | Pin | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **IMU** SDA | 18 | I²C data (MPU6500 @ 0x68) |
| **IMU** SCL | 19 | I²C clock |
| **Encoder LEFT (M1)** A | 14 | quadrature |
| **Encoder LEFT (M1)** B | 15 | quadrature |
| **Encoder RIGHT (M2)** A | 11 | quadrature |
| **Encoder RIGHT (M2)** B | 12 | quadrature |
| **Motor LEFT (M1)** PWM | 1 | → driver `VAR/AI2` (speed) |
| **Motor LEFT (M1)** IN_A / FWD | 20 | → driver `FWD/DI1` |
| **Motor LEFT (M1)** IN_B / REV | 21 | → driver `REV/DI2` |
| **Motor RIGHT (M2)** PWM | 5 | → driver `VAR/AI2` (speed) |
| **Motor RIGHT (M2)** IN_A / FWD | 6 | → driver `FWD/DI1` |
| **Motor RIGHT (M2)** IN_B / REV | 8 | → driver `REV/DI2` |
| Debug LED | 13 | init/status (3 blinks = init failure) |
| micro-ROS | USB | native serial, 115200 baud |

> These values are the firmware's pin configuration — see `openamr-platform-fw`.
> Note: `MOTOR1_PWM` is pin **1** (pin 21 is **not** a PWM pin on the Teensy 4.x — a common upstream pitfall).

The same assignment is shown as a physical pin map below.

## Driver wiring — ZBLD C20-120L2R (VERIFIED 2026-06-19)

Both drivers are wired **identically** (only the Teensy pins differ). The signal terminal block has 12
positions; **exactly 4 are connected** per driver (read off the board: `x`=wired, `o`=empty, from FWD):

```
FWD/DI1  REV/DI2  JOG/DI3  CLR/DI4  BRK/DI5  COM  VAR/AI2  +5V  ERR/DO1  SPD/DO2  A+  B-
   x        x        o        o        o      x      x      o      o        o     o   (o)
```

| Driver terminal | Role | ← Teensy LEFT (M1) | ← Teensy RIGHT (M2) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `VAR/AI2` | speed setpoint, analog **0–5 V** (Teensy PWM @3 kHz, filtered) | PWM **1** | PWM **5** |
| `FWD/DI1` | forward direction (digital) | IN_A **20** | IN_A **6** |
| `REV/DI2` | reverse direction (digital) | IN_B **21** | IN_B **8** |
| `COM` | **common ground — mandatory** | GND | GND |

The driver's connected terminals and their Teensy links are shown below.

![Figure 3 — ZBLD.C20-120L2R driver connections: the 12-position signal block (only terminals 1/2/6/7 wired), 24 V power, and the 8-pin motor Molex](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-hw/main/electrical/wiring/diagrams/driver-connections.svg)

Unused: `JOG/DI3`, `CLR/DI4`, `BRK/DI5` (brake), `+5V`, `ERR/DO1` (no fault read-back), `SPD/DO2`
(no speed feedback to the Teensy), `A+/B−` (RS485 not used). Speed/gain is set by the on-board **VAR/AI1**
pot + **ACC/DEC** ramp pot (see [motors-drivers.md](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-hw/blob/main/electrical/motor_control/motors-drivers.md)).

> ⚠️ The Teensy uses the `USE_GENERIC_2_IN_MOTOR_DRIVER` profile (PWM + INA + INB). On this BLDC driver
> that maps cleanly: PWM→speed (`VAR/AI2`), INA→`FWD/DI1`, INB→`REV/DI2`. The driver does its own
> commutation from the Hall sensors — the Teensy never sees U/V/W.

### DIP switches (config applied 2026-06-19, identical both drivers)
| SW1 | SW2 | SW3 | SW4 | SW5 | SW6 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **OFF** | **ON** | OFF | **ON** | **ON** | OFF |

The switch positions are shown below.

![Figure 4 — driver DIP switches SW1..SW6 in the applied configuration (OFF·ON·OFF·ON·ON·OFF)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-hw/main/electrical/wiring/diagrams/driver-dip-switches.svg)

- **SW1 = OFF → open loop** (driver is a power stage; the **Teensy PID** is the sole regulator — best
  for this robot, removes the double loop). *Was ON (closed loop); changed 2026-06-19.* Validated: smooth.
- **SW2 = ON → speed source = AI2** (the external 0–5 V input where our PWM arrives). Must stay ON.
- **SW4 = ON, SW5 = ON → 5 pole pairs** (motor is P=5). *Was OFF/OFF (=2 pp, wrong); corrected.*
  Irrelevant in open loop but set correctly for future closed-loop use.
- **SW6 = OFF** (no RS485). See the full rationale in [motors-drivers.md](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-hw/blob/main/electrical/motor_control/motors-drivers.md).
- ⚠️ With SW2=ON (AI2 source), the **VAR pot is inert** for balancing — speed comes from the PWM, not the
  pot. The residual ~9 % open-loop L/R asymmetry is handled by the Teensy PID (→ ~0.2 %).

## Motor wiring (per motor) — VERIFIED 2026-06-19
Driver **power**: `V+ / V− = 24 V DC` (大 screw terminals, bottom-right, `电源DC24V`), fused.

> ⚠️ **DC power wire colours on THIS robot** (confirmed 2026-06-18, counter-intuitive — AC-style colours on
> a DC bus): **brown = + (V+, i.e. the DC "red")**, **blue = − (V−, i.e. the DC "black")**. Colour is only a
> presumption — **verify with a multimeter** before connecting a 24 V lead. See [power.md](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-hw/blob/main/electrical/power_distribution/power.md).

Driver **motor connector** (white Molex, 8 pins):

| `U` | `V` | `W` | `Hu` | `Hv` | `Hw` | `Vcc` | `0V` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| phase U | phase V | phase W | Hall U | Hall V | Hall W | +5 V (Hall supply) | GND (Hall) |

> 🔧 **Left-wheel blocker:** the left signal wiring (4 terminals above) is **proven healthy**, so the
> intermittent left wheel is NOT here — it's on the **24 V power (V+/V−)** or the **motor connector**
> (a phase or the Molex). That's where to chase the faux-contact (continuity test while flexing). See
> the `openamr-platform-sw` troubleshooting doc (`docs/troubleshooting/diagnostics.md` in that repo) and the `amr-left-wheel-faux-contact` memo.

## Grounding
All grounds must be common: **Teensy GND ↔ driver COM**. A floating COM was a real source of noise
concern (see the `openamr-platform-sw` troubleshooting doc (`docs/troubleshooting/diagnostics.md` in that repo)).

## Schneider (genuine, ~€20–35):
Harmony XB4-BS542 — Ø22 mm mount, red Ø40 mm mushroom, twist-to-release, metal bezel, 1NC (add a ZBE-102 block for a second NC channel). Certified positive-opening contacts per IEC 60947-5-5 — the one to use for anything CE-facing.
→ https://www.se.com/ww/en/product/XB4BS542/
Plastic-bezel equivalent: XB5-AS542, same page structure at se.com.

## Chinese clone (~€1–5):
XB2-BS542 — same Ø22/Ø40 form factor, 1NC, twist release, 10 A Ith, IP65, IEC 60947-5-1, but no e-stop-specific certification. Fine for prototypes and internal testing.

→ direct from manufacturer, ~$1/pc: https://www.finglai.com/products/switches/push-buttons/DIA22-XB2-B/XB2-BS542.html
LAY37 is the same class, usually sold as NO+NC: https://www.amazon.com/LAY37-Mushroom-Emergency-Button-Switch/dp/B07DL333VL [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/356714450971)[Electric-b2c](https://www.electric-b2c.com/products/button-switch-self-reset-xb2-small-mushroom-head-emergency-stop-22mm-knob-key-start-inching-power-on-xb2-bs542-xb2-ba31-xb2-ba42)

Reminder: contacts are ~3 A DC-13 at 24 V, so for the OpenAMRobot battery bus, break a contactor coil with the NC contacts rather than the full motor current.
