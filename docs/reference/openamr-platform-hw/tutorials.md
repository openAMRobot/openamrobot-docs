**Applies to:** the documented OpenAMRobot reference mobile base; verify repository revision before changing hardware or firmware.

!!! warning "Experimental project documentation"
    These instructions describe the current reference build and its measured behavior. Use physical safeguards, test with wheels clear of the floor, and revalidate after changing parts, wiring, firmware, battery chemistry, or geometry.

## Overview
Two **BLDC** (brushless) motors, one per wheel, each driven by its own **ZBLD** driver. The Teensy
sends low-current logic signals to the drivers; the drivers deliver the 24 V power to the motor phases.

- **Motors**: **ZD Z4BLD60-24GN-30S** ×2 — 3-phase BLDC, 24 V, **60 W**, **P=5 (5 pole pairs, on the
  nameplate)**, **3000 rpm** motor + **1:25 spur gearbox** (4GN 25K) → **120 rpm** wheel, rated **3.8 A**.
  U/V/W + Hall. (LEFT=M1, RIGHT=M2) See the [sizing calculations](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-hw/blob/main/datasheets/motor-sizing-calculations.md).
- **Drivers**: **ZBLD.C20-120L2R** ×2 (24 V, 7.5 A, 120 W). Full specs + datasheets:
  [components-bom.md](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-hw/blob/main/manufacturing/bom/components-bom.md). **Red LED / fault blink codes:**
  [motor-driver-fault-codes.md](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-hw/blob/main/electrical/motor_control/motor-driver-fault-codes.md).
- ⚠️ **Pole pairs = 5** → verify the driver **DIP SW4/SW5** are set to 5 pole pairs (read the silkscreen
  table on the driver). A wrong pole-pair setting throws off the driver's closed-loop speed scaling.

*Source: ZD **ZBLD.C20-120L2R** product manual (manufacturer reference figure). This robot wires only a
subset of these terminals and uses a specific DIP configuration — both are detailed below.*

## Communication (Teensy → driver)

The motor-control signal chain is shown below.

![Figure — per-wheel signal chain: /cmd_vel → Teensy PID (closed loop) → ZBLD driver (open loop) → BLDC → 25:1 gearbox → wheel → AS5040 encoder back to the PID](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-hw/main/electrical/motor_control/diagrams/signal-chain.svg)

Per motor, 3 logic lines from the Teensy:

| Teensy signal | Driver input | Meaning | Left pin | Right pin |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PWM | `VAR / AI2` | speed setpoint — Teensy PWM @ **3 kHz** on this robot (driver capability: PWM 0–20 kHz, or analog 0–5 V) | **1** | **5** |
| IN_A | `FWD / DI1` | forward direction | **20** | **6** |
| IN_B | `REV / DI2` | reverse direction | **21** | **8** |
| GND | `COM` | **common ground (mandatory)** | GND | GND |

- Power side: `DC+ / DC− = 24 V` (with a fuse). Motor side: phases U/V/W + Hall.
- ⚠️ The driver `COM` **must** be tied to the Teensy GND, otherwise signals/encoders are noisy.

Of the driver's twelve control terminals, this robot wires only **four** — the connections are shown below:

![Driver terminal wiring: only DI1 (FWD), DI2 (REV), COM (GND), and AI2 (VAR/PWM speed setpoint) go to the Teensy; DC+/DC- take the fused 24 V and U/V/W + Hall go to the motor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-hw/main/electrical/wiring/diagrams/driver-connections.svg)

## Driver configuration — DIP switches (SW1–SW6)
Both drivers must be set **identically**. Functions read from the driver silkscreen (2026-06-19):

| Switch | Function | What it does | Was (pre 06-19) | **Now (applied 06-19)** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SW1** | open / closed loop (`开环/闭环`) | ON = driver regulates speed itself from the Halls; OFF = driver is just a power stage (Teensy regulates) | ON | **OFF** |
| **SW2** | speed source (`AI1/AI2`) | OFF = internal VAR knob; ON = external 0–5 V on `VAR/AI2` (our Teensy PWM) | ON | ON |
| **SW3** | secondary (direction/internal) | no effect here (direction is driven by FWD/REV pins) | OFF | OFF |
| **SW4 / SW5** | **motor pole pairs** (`极对数`) | tells the driver the pole-pair count (2/3/4/5) to convert Hall freq → RPM. **Only used in closed loop** | OFF/OFF (= 2 pp ⚠️) | **ON/ON (= 5 pp)** |
| **SW6** | RS485 termination (`485 终端电阻`) | bus end resistor; not used (no RS485) | OFF | OFF |

> 🔶 **Pole-pair mismatch found & corrected (2026-06-19):** the motor is **P=5** (5 pole pairs, on the
> nameplate) but SW4/SW5 were OFF/OFF (= 2 pole pairs). Now set to **ON/ON (= 5 pp)**. (Only matters in
> closed loop; harmless but correct in the current open-loop config.)

### Which controller is best — driver vs Teensy PID?
The **Teensy PID is the better controller for this robot** and should be the authoritative one:
- it reads the **AS5040 encoder (1024 cnt/rev)** → fine resolution, and measures the **wheel** speed
  (post-gearbox) — the variable we actually care about (motion + odometry);
- it is **fully tunable** (K_P/K_I/K_D, already tuned to ±2 %), and feeds ROS `/odom`.
- the driver's loop measures the **motor shaft** (pre-gearbox) with **coarse Hall** sensors, is **opaque**
  (only VAR/ACC pots), and needs correct pole pairs.

→ **Run the driver open-loop (SW1=OFF)** so the Teensy is the sole regulator (removes the double-loop that
worsens snaking; makes pole pairs irrelevant). **Plan B** if low-speed cogging appears: go back to closed
loop (SW1=ON) **with SW4/SW5=ON/ON (5 pp)** for a proper cascade (fast driver inner loop + Teensy outer).
The only edge the driver loop has: at low *wheel* speed the motor shaft still spins ~30× faster → richer
Hall signal → potentially smoother very-low-speed than the 50 Hz Teensy loop.

**Config applied 2026-06-19 (both drivers):** `SW1 OFF · SW2 ON · SW3 OFF · SW4 ON · SW5 ON · SW6 OFF`.
(Was SW1 ON, SW2 ON, rest OFF.) **Validated** over 3 motor runs — see
the `openamr-platform-sw` troubleshooting doc (`docs/troubleshooting/diagnostics.md` in that repo).

> ⚠️ **VAR pot is inert in this config**: with SW2=ON the speed comes from AI2 (the PWM), not the VAR/AI1
> pot, so turning VAR does **not** balance the wheels (confirmed: no change across runs). The residual
> ~9 % open-loop L/R asymmetry (right faster) is corrected by the **Teensy PID** (→ ~0.2 % in closed loop).

## Driver configuration — TWO trim pots (CRITICAL)
Each driver has **two** potentiometers. **They must match between LEFT and RIGHT** (calibrate the right
to the left, the known-good reference).

> ⚠️ **Read this alongside the config state.** The VAR **gain** effect below (and the "runaway" root cause)
> applies when **VAR is in the speed path** — i.e. the *original* config (VAR/AI1 selected, or an AI2 gain
> that scales the PWM). In the **current config (SW1=OFF open loop, SW2=ON → AI2)** the **speed comes from
> the PWM on AI2, so the VAR pot is inert for balancing** (see the note above) — the values below are the
> setting to leave it at, not a live balancing knob. ACC/DEC still ramps in either config.

| Pot | Location | Function | Correct setting | Symptom if wrong (when VAR is in the speed path) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **VAR** | top | speed / gain (PWM → speed) | ~3.5/10, **same** both sides | too high → wheel runs ~8× too fast → **runaway** |
| **ACC/DEC** | near the DIP switches | acceleration/deceleration ramp | **4/10**, same both sides | =0 → no smoothing → **jerks/oscillation** in closed loop |

See the full story in the `openamr-platform-sw` troubleshooting doc (`docs/troubleshooting/diagnostics.md` in that repo).

## Low-speed behaviour — measured velocity floors (2026-07-02)
Closed-loop sweep **on the ground / under load** (`/cmd_vel` with the PID + dither, as in docking),
real velocity read on `/odom/unfiltered`:

| Axis | Stall | Judder | **Reliable floor** | Clean |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Linear** | ≤ 0.02 m/s | 0.03 (min 0, std 0.018) | **0.04 m/s** (min 0.020) | **0.05 m/s** (std 0.004); 0.06–0.10 perfect |
| **Angular** | ≤ 0.08 rad/s | 0.10–0.12 (min 0, high std) | **0.15 rad/s** (min 0.093) | 0.20–0.30 perfect |

> ✅ **The motor is WELL-SIZED (over-sized on torque).** Above the floors the real/commanded ratio is
> **~1.0** → no torque shortfall. The floors are **stick-slip (static friction) + coarse Hall commutation
> at low RPM** (an *operating-point* limit, not a sizing one). Reference: the Z4BLD60-24GN-30S + **1:25**
> gearbox gives a mechanical no-load max of ~**1.26 m/s** (software-capped to ~0.71 m/s) and ~**3.48 N·m/wheel**
> (specs in [components-bom.md](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-hw/blob/main/manufacturing/bom/components-bom.md), derivation in the
> [sizing calculations](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-hw/blob/main/datasheets/motor-sizing-calculations.md)).

**Consequence:** keep commanded velocities **above the floors**. Docking applies this (drive taper floored
at 0.05 m/s, scan rotation 0.17 rad/s, a `min_turn_omega` of 0.15 rad/s with a small deadband so
sub-floor yaw corrections are snapped up or zeroed rather than stalling). Judder on each start-from-standstill
is the static-friction breakaway; a taper (or the driver ACC/DEC ramp) mitigates it.

## Good to know / gotchas
- The original fault ("right wheel runs away, robot doesn't go straight") was **100 % driver tuning**, in
  the **original config where VAR was in the speed path**: the right VAR pot was at max (10) and its
  ACC/DEC pot at 0. After matching both pots to the left, the right wheel tracked correctly. *(Separately,
  during open-loop balancing on 2026-06-19, raising the right VAR made the right wheel speed up to match a
  faster left — same knob, opposite direction, because it was a different starting point.)*
- ⚠️ In the **current config (SW2=ON, AI2 source)** VAR no longer balances the wheels — the residual L/R
  asymmetry is handled entirely by the **Teensy PID** (the right channel needs slightly more PWM for the
  same speed; the PID compensates → ~0.2 % in closed loop). Do not chase balance with the VAR pot here.
- Test the motors safely with the **open-loop mode** (`/debug/openloop`) which bypasses the PID — useful
  to compare the two channels at identical PWM. See the `openamr-platform-fw` debug-telemetry doc (`docs/architecture/debug-telemetry.md`).
- **Always**: wheels off the ground, 24 V on, a hand on the 24 V cut-off for the first tests.

## Engineering handoff

- Record the repository commit, hardware revision, supply voltage, and test configuration with every result.
- Stop if observed wiring, component labels, geometry, or topic behavior differs from this page; resolve the discrepancy in the owning repository first.
