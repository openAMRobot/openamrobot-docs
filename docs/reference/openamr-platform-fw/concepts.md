# Firmware control architecture

**Canonical source:** [`openamr-platform-fw/docs/architecture/control-loop.md`](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-fw/blob/main/docs/architecture/control-loop.md)
**Applies to:** the documented OpenAMRobot reference mobile base; verify repository revision before changing hardware or firmware.

!!! warning "Experimental project documentation"
    These instructions describe the current reference build and its measured behavior. Use physical safeguards, test with wheels clear of the floor, and revalidate after changing parts, wiring, firmware, battery chemistry, or geometry.

*Applies to the Teensy 4.0 `linorobot2_overlay` firmware.*

The firmware runs a fixed-rate control loop that turns `/cmd_vel` into per-wheel PWM,
publishes wheel odometry, and streams debug telemetry. This document describes the loop,
the velocity controller, and the compiled configuration for this robot.

## The 50 Hz loop (`src/firmware.ino`)

A micro-ROS timer fires every **20 ms** (50 Hz) → `controlCallback` → `moveBase()` then
`publishData()`.

```
/cmd_vel (Twist)
   │
   ▼
kinematics.getRPM(vx, vy, wz) ─► target rpm per wheel  (motor1 = LEFT, motor2 = RIGHT)
   │                                   ▲
   │  encoder + velocity estimator ────┘ measured rpm (ripple-corrected)
   ▼
feedforward(target) + pid.compute(target, measured) ─► PWM ─► motor.spin() ─► driver ─► wheel
   │
   ▼
kinematics.getVelocities(rpm1..4) ─► measured vx, wz
   │
   ▼
odometry.update() ─► /odom/unfiltered
```

`moveBase()` selects one of three exclusive paths each tick, checked in this order:

1. **Open-loop diagnostic** — active only when a bounded `/debug/openloop` command is fresh
   (< 300 ms). Bypasses the PID and drives a fixed PWM. See
   [debug telemetry](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-fw/blob/main/docs/architecture/debug-telemetry.md).
2. **Command watchdog stop** — if no `/cmd_vel` arrived within **200 ms**, the loop does a
   deterministic full stop (brake + PID reset). See [motion safety](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-fw/blob/main/docs/safety/motion-safety.md).
3. **Closed-loop control** — the normal path (below).

Odometry is integrated on **every** tick regardless of which path ran.

## Velocity controller (closed-loop path)

The closed-loop control path is shown in the block diagram below.

![The 50 Hz per-wheel velocity controller: setpoint from /cmd_vel, error into a PID (Kp 2.0/Ki 0.1/Kd 0.1) with back-calculation anti-windup, plus feedforward + dither, to bounded PWM -> ZBLD driver -> BLDC motor; AS5040 encoder counts pass a runtime ripple table before becoming measured RPM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-fw/main/docs/architecture/diagrams/motor-control-loop-per-wheel.svg)


Per wheel, the commanded PWM is a **feedforward + PID** sum:

```
pwm = feedforward(target_rpm) + pid.compute(target_rpm, measured_rpm)
```

- **Feedforward** supplies the bulk of the holding PWM directly:
  `pwm_ff = kff · target_rpm ± ff_offset` (the `ff_offset` stiction term is added in the
  direction of motion). Defaults: `KFF_DEFAULT = 7.87` PWM/rpm, `FF_OFFSET_DEFAULT = 21` PWM.
  Because the feedforward already knows the PWM needed for a given speed, the integral barely
  works, so the **closed-loop response has the same shape at every speed** (no
  speed-dependent windup/overshoot).
- **PID** (`lib/pid/pid.cpp`) only trims the residual error. One PID per wheel, output clamped
  to `[PWM_MIN, PWM_MAX]`. The integral uses **back-calculation anti-windup**: on saturation the
  excess is subtracted straight back out of the integral (`integral -= (pid − limit) / K_I`), so
  `K_I · integral` only ever supplies what is actually achievable. This *bleeds* the windup out
  rather than a static clamp or a conditional freeze — a long saturated rise no longer overshoots.
  Upstream linorobot2 had an unbounded integral that "catapulted" on saturation.
- **Right-wheel balance**: `motor2` PWM is scaled by `motor2_gain` (default `MOTOR2_GAIN = 1.000`).
  The feedforward + integral now carry the drivetrain asymmetry, so no per-wheel gain scaling is
  needed; the scalar is kept live-tunable for convenience.

> **Differential-drive rule:** both wheels share a **single** `K_P/K_I/K_D` set (identical
> closed-loop dynamics → the robot tracks straight). Established left/right asymmetry is
> compensated with the scalar `motor2_gain`, **not** with per-wheel gains (per-wheel gains make
> the robot veer on start).

### Low-speed handling

At docking speeds the raw encoder rate is too coarse and static friction dominates. Two
mechanisms address this:

- **Small-window velocity estimator** — instead of counts-per-fixed-20 ms (only ~1 count per
  sample below ~5 rpm → ±70 % quantization noise that the PID would chase), the firmware measures
  the time to accumulate a fixed **12-count** displacement (`Δcounts / Δt`, Δt at microsecond
  precision). Look-back is capped at 200 ms. Lag is ~20–30 ms at nav speed (negligible).
- **Anti-stiction dither** — below `DITHER_BELOW_RPM = 13` rpm, a PWM of `±dither_amp`
  (`DITHER_DEFAULT = 92`) is flipped every control tick (≈25 Hz square wave, net average 0). It
  keeps the wheels micro-moving so static friction never grabs, converting the 0→9 rpm stick-slip
  limit cycle into smooth slow motion down to ~0.06 m/s. Above 13 rpm it is disabled.

See [encoder calibration](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-fw/blob/main/docs/architecture/encoder-calibration.md) for the ripple correction applied to the
measured rpm, and [motion safety](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-fw/blob/main/docs/safety/motion-safety.md) for the measured velocity floors.

## Kinematics & odometry

- `LINO_BASE = DIFFERENTIAL_DRIVE`; `motor1 = LEFT`, `motor2 = RIGHT` (motors 3/4 unused).
- For pure forward motion both wheels get the same target rpm. Per-wheel wheel velocity:
  ```
  v_right = vx + wz · (LR_WHEELS_DISTANCE / 2)
  v_left  = vx − wz · (LR_WHEELS_DISTANCE / 2)
  ```
  `LR_WHEELS_DISTANCE` (0.46 m) is the **track** (wheel separation), not the wheel diameter (0.2 m).
- `max_rpm = (MOTOR_POWER_MAX_VOLTAGE / MOTOR_OPERATING_VOLTAGE) · MOTOR_MAX_RPM · MAX_RPM_RATIO`.
  With real 24 V power both voltages must be **24** or the RPM ceiling is halved.
- Odometry is integrated from the measured wheel velocities and published on `/odom/unfiltered`
  (the host EKF fuses it with the IMU). An abnormal first/large `dt` (> 0.5 s) is rejected so the
  first sample doesn't jump.

## Compiled configuration (`config/lino_base_config.h`)

Values for **this** robot (differ from upstream linorobot2 defaults):

| `#define` | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `LINO_BASE` | `DIFFERENTIAL_DRIVE` | 2 driven wheels |
| `USE_GENERIC_2_IN_MOTOR_DRIVER` | — | PWM + 2 direction pins (INA/INB) |
| `USE_MPU9250_IMU` | — | chip is actually an **MPU-6500** (see [bringup](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-fw/blob/main/docs/bringup/micro-ros-bringup.md)) |
| `K_P / K_I / K_D` | `2.0 / 0.1 / 0.1` | K_I low because the feedforward does the holding (2026-06-29) |
| `MOTOR2_GAIN` | `1.000` | right-wheel PWM scale; FF + integral carry the asymmetry |
| `MOTOR_MAX_RPM` | `80` | |
| `MAX_RPM_RATIO` | `0.85` | usable ceiling = 68 rpm |
| `MOTOR_OPERATING_VOLTAGE` / `MOTOR_POWER_MAX_VOLTAGE` | `24` / `24` | must match real supply |
| `COUNTS_PER_REV1..4` | `1024` | encoder CPR |
| `WHEEL_DIAMETER` | `0.2` | m |
| `LR_WHEELS_DISTANCE` | `0.46` | m, track (measured 2026-06-19) |
| `PWM_BITS` / `PWM_FREQUENCY` | `10` / `3000` | `PWM_MAX = 1023`, `PWM_MIN = −1023` |
| `MOTOR1_ENCODER_INV` / `MOTOR2_ENCODER_INV` | `true` / `false` | encoder sign |
| `MOTOR1_INV` / `MOTOR2_INV` | `false` / `true` | motor direction sign |
| `MOTOR1_PWM / IN_A / IN_B` | `1 / 20 / 21` | LEFT (pin 1 is PWM-capable on Teensy 4.x; 21 is not) |
| `MOTOR2_PWM / IN_A / IN_B` | `5 / 6 / 8` | RIGHT |
| `MOTOR1_ENCODER_A / B` | `14 / 15` | LEFT quadrature |
| `MOTOR2_ENCODER_A / B` | `11 / 12` | RIGHT quadrature |
| `BAUDRATE` | `115200` | **must match the micro-ROS agent** |

The following live in `src/firmware.ino` (compiled defaults, live-tunable via `/debug/tune`):

| Symbol | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `KFF_DEFAULT` | `7.87` | feedforward gain (PWM/rpm) |
| `FF_OFFSET_DEFAULT` | `21` | feedforward stiction offset (PWM) |
| `DITHER_DEFAULT` | `92` | anti-stiction dither amplitude (PWM) |
| `DITHER_BELOW_RPM` | `13` | dither active only below this target rpm |

> ⚠️ The build env `teensy40` uses `config/lino_base_config.h`, **not** any `dev_config.h`.
> Edit `lino_base_config.h` for gain/pin/geometry changes.

## Tuning history (context)

The gains reached the current values in two stages:

1. **2026-06-18 step-response tune (no feedforward):** raised the original slow gains to
   `K_P 0.6 / K_I 0.35 / K_D 0.15`; K_I was the dominant fix (killed a ~−26 % steady-state error).
   Adding K_D did not help — it amplifies the quantized rpm noise, and the right-wheel overshoot
   was dominated by driver dynamics + measurement quantization (the measurement noise floor), not
   by gains.
2. **2026-06-29 feedforward re-architecture (current):** with the feedforward carrying the holding
   PWM, K_I was lowered to `0.1` and K_P raised to `2.0`; the response became speed-independent and
   `MOTOR2_GAIN` returned to `1.000`. The low-speed velocity estimator and anti-stiction dither were
   added at the same time.

The left wheel's low-speed "oscillation" was ultimately traced to an **encoder measurement**
artefact, not the gains — see [encoder calibration](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-fw/blob/main/docs/architecture/encoder-calibration.md).
