# Calibrate encoder ripple

**Canonical source:** [`openamr-platform-fw/docs/architecture/encoder-calibration.md`](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-fw/blob/main/docs/architecture/encoder-calibration.md)
**Applies to:** the documented OpenAMRobot reference mobile base; verify repository revision before changing hardware or firmware.

!!! warning "Experimental project documentation"
    These instructions describe the current reference build and its measured behavior. Use physical safeguards, test with wheels clear of the floor, and revalidate after changing parts, wiring, firmware, battery chemistry, or geometry.

*Applies to the Teensy 4.0 `linorobot2_overlay` firmware.*

The left wheel showed a slow low-speed "oscillation" (a ~1 s, ±6 rpm limit cycle) that barely
responded to PID gains. It was **not** a control-loop problem: the left AS5040 magnet is
off-centre, so the *measured* rpm carries a geometric ripple that the PID was chasing. This page
documents the ripple, the deployed runtime correction table + per-boot phase re-align (the working
fix), and why a static/compiled table can't work and the velocity filter was rejected.

## The ripple (measured)

An open-loop constant-speed sweep, binning measured rpm by wheel angle (`counts mod CPR`), showed:

- **LEFT wheel:** a **2-cycle-per-revolution, ~40 % peak-to-peak** error (≈ 0.85 → 1.22),
  **identical at 120 / 180 / 250 PWM** → locked to wheel *angle*, not time = a mechanical encoder
  defect (off-centre / tilted AS5040 magnet), not a real speed oscillation.
- **RIGHT wheel:** only ~±4 % (well aligned).

No PID gain can remove an artefact that is in the measurement itself.

## Runtime correction table (`/debug/enc_cal`)

The firmware holds a per-wheel correction table and divides the measured rpm by the table entry at
the current wheel angle:

```
true_rpm = measured_rpm / CAL[bin],   bin = (counts mod CPR) · NBINS / CPR
```

- `ENC_CAL_NBINS = 36` bins, `ENC_CAL_CPR = 1024`. Two tables: `LEFT_CAL[36]`, `RIGHT_CAL[36]`.
- Applied in `calib_rpm()` to `current_rpm1/2` **before** the PID and odometry — instant, no
  averaging, no lag. A table entry ≤ 0.05 is ignored (guard against divide-by-tiny).
- Loaded at runtime via `/debug/enc_cal` (`std_msgs/Float32MultiArray`, 72 floats = 36 left then
  36 right). Until a table is received, both tables default to **1.0 = passthrough** (raw rpm), so
  an un-calibrated boot behaves exactly like no correction.

## Why the table is loaded at runtime, not compiled in

The encoder is read **incrementally**: counts start from 0 at every Teensy boot, at whatever
position the wheel happens to be in. So `counts mod 1024` is an angle **relative to the boot
position**, not an absolute wheel angle. Every reflash reboots the Teensy and shifts the encoder
zero by a random (and different left/right) angle.

A **compiled-in table would therefore be applied at the wrong phase** after every flash. A
compiled table was tried and failed to converge (it even produced an anti-phase result that
*doubled* the ripple). The working approach loads the table at runtime so its phase matches the
current boot's encoder zero.

## Calibration workflow (host-side)

The calibration workflow is shown below.

![Per-boot encoder ripple calibration workflow: (1) power-cycle the Teensy immobile, (2) spin the wheels in the air with align_enc_cal.py (~8 s), (3) measure the AS5040 per-position ripple (~±40%), (4) compute and push the correction table over /debug/enc_cal, (5) the firmware loads it at runtime phase-aligned per boot → ripple drops to ~±4%. A compiled static table does not work because the incremental encoder loses phase at boot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-fw/main/docs/architecture/diagrams/encoder-ripple-calibration-workflow.svg)


The **shape** of the ripple is fixed (it is the magnet geometry); only its **phase** moves per
boot. So the shape is captured once as a reference, and each boot only re-aligns the phase:

1. A reference table (fixed shape) lives in the host tooling
   ([`tools/encoder-calibration/encoder_ref_table.json`](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-fw/blob/main/tools/encoder-calibration)). The
   alignment scripts are host-side (they run on the Pi / a dev PC, not on the Teensy) and are
   vendored in this repo under [`tools/encoder-calibration/`](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-fw/blob/main/tools/encoder-calibration).
2. After **every Teensy power-cycle**, a short alignment run (~6–8 s) spins the wheels, measures
   the raw per-angle ripple, correlates it sub-bin (~1°) against the reference to find the current
   phase, rolls the reference to that phase, and publishes the 72-float table on `/debug/enc_cal`.
   Run it from the host, wheels off the ground, with the micro-ROS agent up and 24 V power on:
   ```bash
   cd tools/encoder-calibration && source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash \
     && export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp ROS_DOMAIN_ID=0 \
     && python3 align_enc_cal.py --arm 250
   ```
   (See [`tools/encoder-calibration/README.md`](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-fw/blob/main/tools/encoder-calibration/README.md) for the
   full-recalibration workflow used when the magnet is physically disturbed.)
3. The table lives in Teensy RAM, so it must be re-sent after a power-cycle — a ROS restart on the
   host does **not** require re-alignment, but a Teensy reboot does.

> ⚠️ **Alignment gotcha:** the alignment routine must flatten the table to 1.0 (passthrough)
> *before* measuring. If it measures with a table already loaded, it reads the residual of the

The **±40 % (LEFT) / ±4 % (RIGHT)** figures above are the **raw, un-calibrated** ripple — what you
see when no table is loaded (unity passthrough) or before `align_enc_cal` has run this boot. After
alignment the residual is **boot-dependent** (the per-boot phase lock is never identical): a clean
full recalibration lands **under ±5 %** on the LEFT, while a fast per-boot alignment can sit higher
(**up to ~±11 %**) depending on how well the phase locked that boot. Either way it is flat, instant,
far below the ±40 % raw, and it survives a reboot once re-aligned.

## The deployed fix (and the alternatives that were rejected)

**The in-use, working ripple fix is the hot-loaded correction table (`calib_rpm`) + a per-boot
phase re-align (`align_enc_cal.py`, ~8 s).** That is what brings LEFT from ±40 % to ±4 % and
survives a reboot once re-aligned. It is a **per-boot ritual** — the phase must be re-aligned every
power-cycle, and the flatten-before-measure gotcha is easy to hit — but it is the deployed solution,
not a stopgap for something else.

What does **not** work, and what was rejected:

- **A static / compiled-in table fails.** The encoder is incremental, so `counts mod CPR` is an
  angle relative to the boot position; every reboot shifts the encoder zero by a random (and
  different left/right) angle, so a fixed table is applied at the wrong phase (see the section
  above). Only a table that is re-aligned at runtime each boot can work.
- **A half-revolution angular velocity filter** (average over 512 counts) cancels the ripple
  cleanly but adds **~0.6 s of lag** — **considered and rejected** for closed-loop control. The
  deployed ripple fix is **not** this velocity filter.
- Do **not** conflate the ripple fix with the firmware's separate **small-window (12-count)
  velocity estimator**: that is only a *low-speed quantization-noise* filter (see
  [control loop](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-fw/blob/main/docs/architecture/control-loop.md)), it does **not** remove the per-angle ripple — the align-table
  does.

**The only durable *hardware* fix is better encoder mounting** (a centred/untilted AS5040 magnet),
which removes the geometric ripple at the source. Until then, the runtime align-table + per-boot
re-alignment is the working solution.
