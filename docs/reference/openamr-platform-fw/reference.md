# Firmware ROS 2 contract

**Canonical source:** [`openamr-platform-fw/docs/bringup/micro-ros-bringup.md`](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-fw/blob/main/docs/bringup/micro-ros-bringup.md)
**Applies to:** the documented OpenAMRobot reference mobile base; verify repository revision before changing hardware or firmware.

!!! warning "Experimental project documentation"
    These instructions describe the current reference build and its measured behavior. Use physical safeguards, test with wheels clear of the floor, and revalidate after changing parts, wiring, firmware, battery chemistry, or geometry.

*Applies to the Teensy 4.0 `linorobot2_overlay` firmware.*

The firmware is a **micro-ROS** application. It connects to a **micro-ROS agent** on the host over
USB serial and exposes the robot's topics. This page covers the connection, the topic contract, and
the LED status codes.

## Transport & agent

The micro-ROS transport topology is shown below.

![The Teensy 4.0 runs a micro-ROS client over USB serial 115200; the micro-ROS agent on the Pi 5 bridges it into the CycloneDDS ROS 2 graph. Teensy publishes /odom/unfiltered, /imu/data_raw, /imu/mag, /debug/left|right|pwm and subscribes /cmd_vel, /debug/openloop|tune|enc_cal; the host EKF/Madgwick produces filtered /imu/data + /odom for Nav2. The control loop runs only while the agent is connected; on disconnect the firmware fullStop()s](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-fw/main/docs/bringup/diagrams/micro-ros-node-topology.svg)


- **USB serial** at **`BAUDRATE = 115200`** — this must match the agent exactly.
- Start the agent on the host, pointing at the Teensy's serial device. A non-interactive shell
  does **not** source ROS, so source it and set the matching RMW/domain first (see the DDS note
  below):
  ```bash
  source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
  source ~/linorobot2_ws/install/setup.bash
  export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp
  export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=0
  ros2 run micro_ros_agent micro_ros_agent serial -b 115200 -D <teensy-serial-by-id>
  ```
  Use the stable `/dev/serial/by-id/usb-Teensyduino_USB_Serial_*-if00` path (not `/dev/ttyACM*`,
  which can renumber).
- The firmware also has an (unused here) WiFi transport option (`USE_WIFI_TRANSPORT`), disabled in
  this config.

> ⚠️ **DDS must match the rest of the stack.** On this robot the host uses CycloneDDS on
> `ROS_DOMAIN_ID=0`. A host defaulting to a different RMW/domain will not see the topics. The agent
> may log harmless `Failed to parse type hash ... USER_DATA (null)` warnings — micro-ROS does not
> populate type hashes; they are not errors.

## Connection state machine

The firmware pings the agent and manages entities automatically:

`WAITING_AGENT` → `AGENT_AVAILABLE` → `AGENT_CONNECTED` → (`AGENT_DISCONNECTED`) → `WAITING_AGENT`.

On disconnect it calls `fullStop()` and destroys its ROS entities, then re-creates them when the
agent returns. Time is synchronised with the agent on connect so stamps are in ROS time.

## Topic contract

| Topic | Direction | Type | QoS |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/cmd_vel` | in | `geometry_msgs/Twist` | reliable |
| `/odom/unfiltered` | out | `nav_msgs/Odometry` | reliable |
| `/imu/data_raw` | out | `sensor_msgs/Imu` | reliable |
| `/imu/mag` | out | `sensor_msgs/MagneticField` | reliable | see note |
| `/debug/left`, `/debug/right`, `/debug/pwm` | out | `geometry_msgs/Vector3` | **best-effort** |
| `/debug/openloop` | in | `geometry_msgs/Vector3` | reliable |
| `/debug/tune` | in | `geometry_msgs/Twist` | reliable |
| `/debug/enc_cal` | in | `std_msgs/Float32MultiArray` | reliable |

- The firmware publishes **raw** IMU (`/imu/data_raw` + `/imu/mag`); the host Madgwick/EKF pipeline
  fuses them into the filtered `/imu/data` and `/odom`.
- ⚠️ **No real magnetometer.** The board carries an **MPU6500**, driven through the MPU9250 driver
  (WHO_AM_I workaround). The MPU6500 has **no magnetometer**, so `/imu/mag` is published for
  message-shape compatibility but carries **no meaningful magnetic field** — do not fuse it as a
  heading source. The host EKF should use the gyro/accel only (yaw from the gyro rate).
- The `/debug/*` topics are covered in detail in
  [debug telemetry](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-fw/blob/main/docs/architecture/debug-telemetry.md).

## IMU note

The config enables `USE_MPU9250_IMU`, but the physical chip is an **MPU-6500** (`WHO_AM_I 0x70`).
The MPU9250 driver recognises it; the MPU6050 driver rejects it. IMU init failure is fatal (see LED
codes below).

## LED status codes (pin 13)

| Blink pattern | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Solid on | agent connected / idle (also toggles on each `/cmd_vel`) |
| Toggling with control | actively driving in closed loop |
| 2 blinks (loop) | fatal RCL error (`rclErrorLoop`) |
| 3 blinks | IMU init failed — **also** any `createEntities()` RCL failure (the non-syslog `RCCHECK` flashes 3 then retries) |
| 4 blinks | magnetometer init failed |

After bringup, if you use the encoder ripple table, run the host alignment once per Teensy
power-cycle — see [encoder calibration](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-fw/blob/main/docs/architecture/encoder-calibration.md).

## Engineering handoff

- Record the repository commit, hardware revision, supply voltage, and test configuration with every result.
- Stop if observed wiring, component labels, geometry, or topic behavior differs from this page; resolve the discrepancy in the owning repository first.
- Report documentation or implementation defects through [the repository issue tracker](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-fw/issues).
