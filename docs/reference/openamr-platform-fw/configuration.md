# Firmware configuration and tuning

**Canonical source:** [`openamr-platform-fw/docs/architecture/debug-telemetry.md`](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-fw/blob/main/docs/architecture/debug-telemetry.md)
**Applies to:** the documented OpenAMRobot reference mobile base; verify repository revision before changing hardware or firmware.

!!! warning "Experimental project documentation"
    These instructions describe the current reference build and its measured behavior. Use physical safeguards, test with wheels clear of the floor, and revalidate after changing parts, wiring, firmware, battery chemistry, or geometry.

*Applies to the Teensy 4.0 `linorobot2_overlay` firmware.*

These topics are **additions to upstream linorobot2**, added for this robot. They were essential
to diagnose the drivetrain and remain the live-tuning and commissioning interface. This page is
the single source of truth for the debug interface; other docs link here.

## Published telemetry (Teensy → host)

The debug topic flow is shown below.

![The /debug topics split by direction: Teensy->host telemetry (best-effort) /debug/left, /debug/right, /debug/pwm; host->Teensy commands (reliable) /debug/openloop (gated by ENABLE_POWERED_DEBUG, can move the motors), /debug/tune, /debug/enc_cal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-fw/main/docs/architecture/diagrams/debug-telemetry-topic-map.svg)


All three are `geometry_msgs/msg/Vector3`, **BEST_EFFORT** QoS, published at the 50 Hz loop rate:

| Topic | x | y | z |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/debug/left`  | target rpm (LEFT)  | **measured rpm (LEFT, corrected)**  | cumulative encoder counts (LEFT) |
| `/debug/right` | target rpm (RIGHT) | **measured rpm (RIGHT, corrected)** | cumulative encoder counts (RIGHT) |
| `/debug/pwm`   | PWM LEFT | PWM RIGHT | 0 |

> ⚠️ **The `y` field is the *corrected* rpm.** The firmware runs the measured rpm through the
> small-window velocity estimator **and** the runtime ripple table (`calib_rpm`) *before*
> publishing (`current_rpm1 → debug_cur_rpm1 → debug_left_msg.y`). Until an encoder table is
> loaded, the ripple correction is unity passthrough, but the velocity-estimator smoothing is
> always applied. If you need the raw signal, use the `z` counts. See
> [encoder calibration](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-fw/blob/main/docs/architecture/encoder-calibration.md).

> ⚠️ **BEST_EFFORT QoS:** a subscriber must request best-effort too, otherwise it receives
> nothing:
> ```
> ros2 topic echo /debug/right --qos-reliability best_effort
> ```

## Commands (host → Teensy)

### `/debug/openloop` — raw open-loop PWM (`geometry_msgs/msg/Vector3`, RELIABLE)

Drives a **fixed PWM, bypassing the PID**, for hardware diagnosis (proving a motor/encoder
channel independently of the closed loop).

- **Only the `x` field is used, and it is applied to *both* motors** (motor2 additionally scaled
  by `motor2_gain`). The `y` and `z` fields are ignored.
- Active only when `|x| ≥ 1` **and** a message arrived within the last **300 ms** (its own
  staleness timeout, separate from the `/cmd_vel` watchdog). Otherwise the loop falls back to
  normal control.
- **Validated & bounded**: NaN/Inf are rejected, and the value is clamped to
  `OPENLOOP_PWM_LIMIT = 0.7 · PWM_MAX ≈ ±716` so a stray/huge command cannot slam the motors.
- **Production gate**: driving motors from this path requires the `ENABLE_POWERED_DEBUG` build
  flag (defined in the current commissioning build). In a production image with the flag removed,
  the subscriber still exists (executor count unchanged) but cannot move the motors.

```
# hold both wheels at PWM 200, republished to beat the 300 ms staleness timeout
ros2 topic pub -r 10 /debug/openloop geometry_msgs/msg/Vector3 "{x: 200.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}"
```

> ⚠️ A prior note described `/debug/openloop` as `x = left PWM, y = right PWM`. That is **not**
> what the firmware does — `y` is ignored and `x` drives both wheels. Use `motor2_gain` (via
> `/debug/tune`) if you need to bias the right wheel.

### `/debug/tune` — live gain tuning (`geometry_msgs/msg/Twist`, RELIABLE)

Updates the controller in RAM (compiled defaults are unchanged; a reflash restores them).

| Field | Target | Applied when |
|---|---|---|
| `linear.x / y / z` | `K_P / K_I / K_D` (both PIDs) | always |
| `angular.x` | `motor2_gain` (right-wheel PWM scale) | `> 0` |
| `angular.y` | `kff` (feedforward gain, PWM/rpm) | `> 0` |
| `angular.z` | `dither_amp` (anti-stiction dither, PWM) | `≥ 0` |

> ⚠️ A code comment near the declaration lists `angular.z = ff_offset`; the **actual** callback
> uses `angular.z = dither_amp`. `ff_offset` is fixed at its tuned default.

```
# set K_P=2.0 K_I=0.1 K_D=0.1, motor2_gain=1.0, kff=7.87, dither=92 (the compiled defaults)
ros2 topic pub --once /debug/tune geometry_msgs/msg/Twist \
  "{linear: {x: 2.0, y: 0.1, z: 0.1}, angular: {x: 1.0, y: 7.87, z: 92.0}}"
```

> A field guarded by `> 0` is left untouched when sent as `0` (so you can nudge one gain without
> disturbing `motor2_gain`/`kff`); `angular.z` (dither) accepts `0` to disable it.

### `/debug/enc_cal` — runtime encoder ripple table (`std_msgs/msg/Float32MultiArray`, RELIABLE)

72 floats = 36 `LEFT_CAL` bins then 36 `RIGHT_CAL` bins. Loaded into RAM and applied instantly.
Full explanation in [encoder calibration](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-fw/blob/main/docs/architecture/encoder-calibration.md).

## Diagnostic recipes

- **Motor/encoder health (wheels raised):** publish equal `/debug/openloop` on both wheels and
  compare `/debug/left.y` vs `/debug/right.y` — this is how the motors/encoders were proven
  healthy independently of the closed loop.
- **Step-response tuning:** command a `/cmd_vel` step and record `/debug/left|right` (`x` target,
  `y` measured) at ≥ 0.25 m/s (below that the rpm is too quantized to tune on).
- All debug subscribers are RELIABLE; the telemetry publishers are BEST_EFFORT.

## Engineering handoff

- Record the repository commit, hardware revision, supply voltage, and test configuration with every result.
- Stop if observed wiring, component labels, geometry, or topic behavior differs from this page; resolve the discrepancy in the owning repository first.
- Report documentation or implementation defects through [the repository issue tracker](https://github.com/openAMRobot/openamr-platform-fw/issues).
